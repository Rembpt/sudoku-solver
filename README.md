This is a fun project just for me to learn some python and algorythm.

This solver works by using the wave function collapse algorythm.

It can solve sudokus of all sizes but isn't very optimised.

To use it, copy your sudoku grid into the "sudoku.txt" file and start the python program.

Very fun project to do, can be used for more impressive things such as generating similar images and more.
